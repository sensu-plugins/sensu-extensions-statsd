# Sensu::Extensions::Template

Welcome to the Sensu Extensions repository template! In this repository, you will find the files you need to be able to author your own Sensu Extension for Sensu Core (>= 0.26).

## Usage

1. Fork this repository and name the fork after your new extension, e.g. `"sensu-extensions-docker"`

2. Write your extension (with tests!)

3. Create a GitHub issue on [sensu-extensions/template](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/template/issues) to request a review of your extension, to determine if it is ready to be moved to the [sensu-extensions GitHub organization](https://github.com/sensu-extensions) to be shared with the Sensu community!
